          --order [name[,name...]]   Change the order or omit elements.

DESCRIPTION
    csvtolatex.pl converts csv data into latex tables. If an ordering is
    specified (with the names of the columns) then that ordering is used for

    they are omitted.

    WARNING the csv should have a well formed header (also comma seperated).
